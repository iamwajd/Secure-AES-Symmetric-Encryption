Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, but its origins are shrouded in mystery and legend. The most famous story involves a goat herder named Kaldi from the Ethiopian plateau. According to the legend, Kaldi noticed that his goats became unusually energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. They were so full of energy that they did not want to sleep at night.

Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.

As word moved east and reached the Arabian Peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the 16th century, it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. Coffee houses, known as "qahveh khaneh," began to appear in cities across the Near East. These places were not just for drinking coffee, but they were also hubs for social activity and information exchange, often referred to as 'Schools of the Wise.'

In the 17th century, coffee made its way to Europe and was initially met with suspicion and fear. However, once it gained approval from Pope Clement VIII, who tasted it and found it satisfying, coffee houses quickly spread throughout England, Austria, France, Germany, and Holland.

Biologically, the coffee plant produces fruits called cherries, and inside these cherries are the seeds we know as beans. The two most commercially important species grown are Arabica and Robusta. Arabica provides a smoother, more complex flavor and accounts for the majority of global production, while Robusta is stronger, more bitter, and contains more caffeine. This biological diversity, combined with different roasting methods, contributes to the vast array of flavors available to consumers today, making coffee not just a drink, but a complex culinary experience.
